# Haemophiliac Helper Â 

SIT305 Advanced-Apps-Development Assignment  
***
An Android medical application for haemophilia patients to record their daily infusion and bleeding activities into tables. And allow them to export the data to their email.  
***  
## Bugs: 

## Fixed:
### Added a function to ask for permission
  1. Can't upload image.  
  2. Carsh when click on send record.(It calls a method to save record into the file in the device)  
They both are caused by one reason (possibly): can't read the file path.  
This often happens on an emulator. But it works fine on my tablet, don't know somehow it can't read other phone's file path.
