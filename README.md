Mobile computing project1 Overwatch Assistant
This is my mobile computing assignment project1. The App name is Overwatch Assistant.

The platform I choose is xamarin.Android using C#. This APP provides a range of information about Overwatch(an online video game). The aim of Overwatch Assistant is with the information it provides, users can gain some useful strategies and experience and improve their skills in game.

This APP consist of three sections: hero, map, guide. Users can choose specific hero or map type, and then choose a specific hero or map from the type to see corresponding details. In guide section, a list of guides is shown, and by clicking one of these guides, it will lead to a webpage to show the content on website, which means the APP require users' Internet access.

Please download the APP from github and run it on xamarin, or using xamring to install it on your personal Android devices. It has three different dpi level to fit different size devices.
